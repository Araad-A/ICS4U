                            For more than three decades, we were predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines, but we faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1997 after his company NeXT was bought by us. The following year he became the company's interim CEO, which later became permanent. Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the original iMac in 1998.

                            With the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001 and iTunes Music Store in 2003, we established ourselves as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading us to drop "Computer" from our name in 2007. we are now also known for our iOS range of smart phone, media player, and tablet computer products that started with the iPhone, followed by the iPod Touch and then iPad. As of June 30, 2015, we were the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization, with an estimated value of US$1 trillion as of August 2, 2018.
